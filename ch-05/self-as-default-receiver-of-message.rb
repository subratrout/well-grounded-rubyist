# The most common use of the dotless method call occurs when youâ€™re calling one instance method from another.

# When the method name ends with an equal sign i.e a setter method you can't omit the object-plus-dot part of method call
# because ruby always interprets the sequence identifier = value as an assignment to local variable


# dotless method invocations allow you to use one method makes use of another
