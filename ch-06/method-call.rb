# Every method call in Ruby has the following syntax:

# A receiver object or variable (defaulting to self if absent)
# A dot (required if thereâ€™s an explicit receiver; disallowed otherwise)
# A method name (required)
# An argument list (optional; defaults to ())
# A code block (optional; no default)
