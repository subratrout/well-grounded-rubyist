# ssignment syntax and conditional expressions cross paths at two points: in the bodies of conditional 
# expressions, where the assignments may or may not happen at all, and in the conditional tests themselves:

if x =1 # Assignment in conditional test
	y =2 # Assignment in coditional body
end

# Local variable assignment in a conditional body
